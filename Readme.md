# CSharp Sorting and removing duplicates without comparison 

The new way of sorting.

This is not a perfect sorting algorithm in any way shape of form. But, 
it does provide really fast sorting for big data. I am working on improving it for each cases.
I will update my latest code soon.

## Please support me on this.

I would really appreciate your input regarding the project. 

## I have the same project in Javascript as well

Please checkout the Javascript version. Give me feedback please.
